# 🏄‍♂️ Osama AL-Tamimi

**`Digital Craftsman (Developer)`**

👋 Hello, I'm Osama. I'm on a continuous learning journey, currently focusing on programming and mastering the English language. I hope there's something great in the future.
You can always find me at [ousama.dev](https://ousama.dev/), where I share my journey and projects. In addition to that, I spend a lot of time playing video games. When I'm not learning programming or English, you'll likely find me immersed in various virtual worlds.

That's me – excited and committed to building a bright future! 🚀
